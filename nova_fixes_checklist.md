# Nova Application Fixes Checklist

## Current Issues

- [x] Session persistence issues - Chat sessions not maintained across page refreshes
- [x] API endpoint mismatches between frontend and backend
- [x] Lack of comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- [x] Missing error recovery mechanisms for API calls
- [x] Authentication token refresh not properly implemented
- [x] Chat history UI needs improvements
- [x] Streaming support inconsistencies in chat interface
- [x] Backend connection error handling issues
- [x] Backend startup errors (ModuleNotFoundError)
- [x] Backend runtime error (coroutine has no len())
- [x] Backend runtime error (TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not callable) in projects router

## Completed Fixes

- [x] Session persistence implemented with localStorage solution (`localStorage.setItem(nova_chat_session_${projectId}, sessionId)`)
- [x] Type definitions created in utils/types.ts for API responses
- [x] Error recovery added with retry mechanism and exponential backoff for API calls
- [x] Authentication refresh functionality implemented
- [x] Chat history UI created with ChatSessionSelector component
- [x] Chat interface updated to handle both streaming and non-streaming responses
- [x] Added streaming toggle with UI indicator for better user experience
- [x] Fixed type errors in ChatInterface component
- [x] Implemented AsyncIterable-based streaming response handler
- [x] Added stream processing for server-sent events (SSE)
- [x] Centralized streaming logic in API utility (streamChat method)
- [x] Added proper TypeScript types for streaming responses
- [x] Enhanced API utility with improved backend connectivity checking and error handling
- [x] Added ApiStatus component to display backend connection status to users (Note: Component temporarily removed from layout per user request)
- [x] Implemented network-aware retry logic for "Failed to fetch" errors
- [x] Corrected ModuleNotFoundError for 'app.core' by fixing import path in database_service.py
- [x] Identified correct backend startup command (`uvicorn app.main:app`)
- [x] Fixed "coroutine has no len()" error in project listing endpoint by adding await
- [x] Fixed "TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not callable" in project get, update, and delete endpoints by adding await
- [x] Fixed `AttributeError: 'UUID' object has no attribute 'replace'` in `backend/app/routers/chat.py` -> `create_chat_session`
- [x] Fixed `TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not iterable` in `backend/app/services/chat_service.py` -> `process_user_message`
- [x] Converted StorageService and storage provider methods to be asynchronous and added awaits
- [x] Fixed `Failed to send message: Unexpected token 'd', "data: {"co"... is not valid JSON` error in frontend streaming by adding SSE parsing logic
- [x] Fixed `ImportError: cannot import name 'default_storage_service' from 'app.services.storage_service'` in `documents.py` by correcting the import to `get_storage_service`.

## Ongoing Optimizations

- [ ] Optimize project fetching - Currently loads all projects instead of getting specific project details (Partial: Listing fixed, still need dedicated endpoint for single project)
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries to prevent UI crashes
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Improve responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features

## Backend Improvements

- [ ] Validate all environment variables on startup
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all endpoints
- [ ] Add row-level security for database operations
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexes
- [ ] Add support for pagination in list endpoints

## Frontend Enhancements

- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Improve loading states and transitions
- [ ] Enhance form validation
- [ ] Add offline support capabilities
