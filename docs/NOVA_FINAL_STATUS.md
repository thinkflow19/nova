# Nova Application - Current Status and Next Steps

## Overview
Nova is a SaaS platform designed to allow users to create private, branded AI chatbots from their uploaded documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo.

## What Has Been Fixed

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Verified Node.js is installed on the machine
- ✅ Installed required Python packages in the backend
- ✅ Updated environment variables for production use
- ✅ Fixed compatibility issues with Pinecone client
- ✅ Fixed compatibility issues with Supabase client

### Backend Fixes
- ✅ Updated Pinecone client initialization to use the newer API format
- ✅ Fixed Supabase client initialization and SQL execution methods
- ✅ Addressed compatibility issues with Python packages

### Frontend Fixes
- ✅ Verified npm dependencies installation
- ✅ Updated frontend environment variables

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Database Setup
- ⚠️ Need to log into Supabase dashboard to create the `exec_sql` function
- ⚠️ Complete the database initialization to create required tables
- ⚠️ Create a test user for development

### API Integration
- ⚠️ Provide real API keys for OpenAI, Pinecone, and AWS S3
- ⚠️ Test S3 integration for document uploads
- ⚠️ Configure Stripe for payments

### System Verification
- ⚠️ Run the backend server and verify all endpoints are working
- ⚠️ Start the frontend server and connect to the backend
- ⚠️ Test the complete user flow from sign-up to chatbot creation

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Complete Database Setup**:
   - Log into Supabase dashboard
   - Run the SQL script to create the `exec_sql` function
   - Complete the database initialization
   - Create a test user

2. **API Configuration**:
   - Replace placeholder API keys with real credentials for:
     - OpenAI API
     - Pinecone
     - AWS S3
     - Stripe

3. **System Testing**:
   - Start the backend server: `cd backend && python -m app.main`
   - Start the frontend server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
   - Verify authentication flow
   - Test document upload
   - Test chatbot creation and conversation

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend to Railway or similar service
   - Deploy the frontend to Vercel
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Configure domains and CORS settings

## Conclusion
The Nova application has been significantly improved by fixing compatibility issues with key libraries and updating the codebase to use the latest API formats. The remaining tasks primarily involve setting up external services (Supabase, OpenAI, AWS, etc.) with real credentials and testing the complete system flow.
