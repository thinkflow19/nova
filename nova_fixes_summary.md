# Nova Application Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements and optimizations implemented in the Nova application, focusing on resolving key issues with the chat functionality, session persistence, API integration, streaming responses, and backend connectivity.

## Key Improvements

### Session Persistence
- Implemented localStorage-based solution to preserve chat sessions across page refreshes
- Added session tracking with `localStorage.setItem('nova_chat_session_${projectId}', sessionId)`
- Created UI to manage and switch between multiple chat sessions

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed API calls
- Implemented proper error recovery for network failures
- Added specific error handling for different HTTP status codes
- Improved user-facing error messages
- Added network-aware retry logic for "Failed to fetch" errors
- Implemented backend connectivity checking with user-friendly error messages (Note: Connectivity status message temporarily removed from UI per user request)

### API Interface Enhancements
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- Fixed endpoint mismatches between frontend and backend
- Added authentication token refresh functionality
- Centralized API configuration in config file

### Streaming Support
- Fixed type errors in ChatInterface component
- Added proper support for both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Implemented AsyncIterable-based streaming response handling
- Created streamChat API method with Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
- Added toggle for users to switch between streaming and non-streaming modes
- Implemented visual indicators for streaming status

### Backend Fixes
- Corrected ModuleNotFoundError for 'app.core' by fixing import path in `backend/app/services/database_service.py`
- Identified correct backend startup command (`cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`)
- Fixed "coroutine has no len()" error in project listing endpoint by adding `await` in `backend/app/routers/projects.py`

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added ChatSessionSelector component for better history management
- Improved loading states with visual indicators
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality for chat messages
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- Implemented proper message typing indicators

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript for type safety
- Next.js for frontend
- React hooks for state management
- localStorage for client-side persistence
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
- Fetch API with Reader streams for handling streaming data
- Connectivity monitoring and network-aware error handling
- FastAPI for backend
- uvicorn as ASGI server
- httpx for async backend requests
- tenacity for retry logic

## Future Improvements
- Optimize project data loading with dedicated endpoints
- Implement proper error boundaries for UI crash prevention
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Enhance accessibility features
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Implement dark mode toggle
- Add offline support capabilities
- Backend Improvements (Validate environment variables, better endpoint error handling, RLS, query optimization, pagination)
